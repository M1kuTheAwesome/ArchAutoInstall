# ArchAutoInstall
## Installation:
In your Arch Linux installation environment, make sure you have enough unpartitioned space and a partition table exists, then run:
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M1kuTheAwesome/ArchAutoInstall/master/install.sh
bash install.sh
```
Answer a few questions for configuration and sit back.

## What is this?
This is my personal Arch Linux automated installation script, which install Arch the way I like it on just about any computer. It supports dual booting with Windows or another Linux, if there is enough unpartitioned free space and if the boot or efi partition is the very first one on the disk. It's just a project I did for learning purposes and, hopefully, it will save me some time on a reinstall at some point. This is my first script of this size and complexity.
